# Virtual Memory Simulation

A simulation of a paging algorithm for managing virtual memory with hierarchical page tables and cyclic distance-based page replacement.

**Course**: Hebrew University Operating Systems  
**Implementation**: VirtualMemory.cpp (all other files provided by course staff)

This project implements:
- Multi-level page table address translation
- Demand paging with page fault handling
- Page eviction using cyclic distance algorithm
- Frame allocation with three-tier search strategy
