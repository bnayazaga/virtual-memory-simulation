# Virtual Memory Simulation

A simulation of a paging algorithm for managing virtual memory with hierarchical page tables and cyclic distance-based page replacement.

**Course**: Hebrew University Operating Systems  
**Implementation**: VirtualMemory.cpp (support files provided by course staff)

This project implements:
- Multi-level page table address translation
- Demand paging with page fault handling
- Page eviction using cyclic distance algorithm
- Frame allocation with three-tier search strategy

**Applied techniques**: DFS traversal, bit manipulation, tree search, low-level memory management

**Key concepts**: Virtual-to-physical address translation, hierarchical page tables, page fault handling

**Note**: C-style implementation in C++ (per OS course requirements)
